Heaii, at first thanks to Download and use use my Tool!
I´m vDroPZz (Github DroPZsec) and this is my first project, a try to upload files on github.
This isn´t my full coding magic, again: This is a try!
For beginners who don´t know to use NMAP is this script perfect.
just type in "./LittleAutoMAP.sh" or "bash LittleAutoMAP.sh" after run "bash Requirements.sh" and you just type in the IP, that´s it.
The Tool is a NMAP script for full Automatation, a fast info gather for all reachable servers and systems.
Follow me on Github for more and more magic!
